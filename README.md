# DynamicWumpusWorld

Remake of a beloved text-based game in which the Wumpus is brought to life using basic path-finding algorithms to chase the player. The game is turn-based but if you stay still for too long, the Wumpus might catch you...

## How to run the game
DynamicWumpusWorld was developed in Processing v2.2.1 and you will need to have this installed in order to run it (we have not tested the game with older versions of Processing). 

Once you've installed Processing 2.2.1, run the program, <b>click</b> on the <b>File tab</b> and open the main/main.pde file located in the game folder.
